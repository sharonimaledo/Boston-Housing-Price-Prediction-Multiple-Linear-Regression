## Project Brief: Boston Housing Price Prediction (Regression Analysis)
## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a multiple linear regression model to predict house prices (MEDV) using housing and environmental features from the Boston Housing dataset.
The analysis aims to identify the key factors that influence property value and evaluate the predictive performance of the model.
## Context
Real estate stakeholders require insight into the factors that drive house prices to support pricing, investment, and location decisions.
Understanding the relationship between structural, environmental, and socioeconomic variables and property value enables more informed decision-making.
## Key Questions

•	Price Drivers: Which variables have the strongest effect on house prices?

•	Model Performance: How accurately can house prices be predicted using the available features?

•	Prediction Use Case: Can the model estimate the price of a new property based on its characteristics?
## Stakeholders
•	Real Estate Investors: Interest in factors that increase property value

•	Urban Planners: Interest in environmental impact on housing prices

•	Home Buyers: Interest in estimating fair property prices
## Data
The analysis uses the Boston Housing dataset, which contains variables such as:

•	Crime rate (CRIM)

•	Residential land zoning (ZN)

•	Industrial proportion (INDUS)

•	Pollution level (NOX)

•	Average number of rooms (RM)

•	Property tax rate (TAX)

•	Pupil–teacher ratio (PTRATIO)

•	Percentage of lower-status population (LSTAT)

•	Median house value (MEDV – target variable)
## Analysis Criteria
•	Data cleaning 

•	Multiple linear regression model using all relevant predictors

•	Model evaluation 

•	Interpretation of regression coefficients

•	Visualization of actual versus predicted values
## Project Deliverables
•	Jupyter Notebook containing the full regression workflow

•	Model performance metrics (R² and RMSE)

•	Interpretation of key predictors of house price

•	Prediction of house price for a new data point
•	Exported PDF report summarizing methodology and findings
